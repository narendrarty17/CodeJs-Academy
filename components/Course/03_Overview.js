                            Hi, I'm Jonas! I'm one of Udemy's Top
                            Instructors and all my premium courses
                            have earned the best-selling status for
                            outstanding performance and student
                            satisfaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm a full-stack web developer and
                            designer with a passion for building
                            beautiful web interfaces from scratch.
                            I've been building websites and apps
                            since 2010 and also have a Master's
                            degree in Engineering.

                        <p>
                            I discovered my passion for teaching
                            and helping others by sharing everything
                            I knew during college. This passion led
                            me to Udemy in 2015, where I now have the
                            privilege of training <b>1,500,000+</b>
                            learners in the field of web development.
